# Author's Note:

1. It's normal to have some rough edges and weird stuff, just touch it up in post-processing, or keep trying until you get a good one.

2. For resolution enhancement, check out someone else's workflow. I generate three images at a time and I'm not sure which color tones you prefer.

# Q & A

Q: What's the purpose of this workflow?

A: You input a reference image and a product image, and it automatically blends them together for you. You can also skip the IPadapter node and use text descriptions to generate the background.

Q: How do I use this workflow?

A: Input a reference background image (you can mask out objects if there are any), input a product image, then click "add prompt queue," and you're done.

Q: What if I get an error?

A: Just post it in the comments. I check them every day at 10 AM, 3 PM, and 9 PM (GMT+8).
